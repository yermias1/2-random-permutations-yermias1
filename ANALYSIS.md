# Assignment 2 Analysis - YOUR NAME HERE

## Algorithm 1

Your test results and analysis here...
This algorithm gets slower as the array grows. Because every new number has to be checked against the numbers already in the array. The bigger the array, the time needed to run increases quickly.

## Algorithm 2

Your test results and analysis here...
This one uses a separate array to keep track of the numbers already used. Run time increases steadily as the array increases.

## Algorithm 3

Your test results and analysis here...
This algorithm fills the array in order first then swaps the elements creating a PERMUTATION. Because there is less handling of each element the run time grows consistently.
